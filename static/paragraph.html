    <h2>Why I chose to make my list about my favorite single player games</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>I decided to make my list about my favorite single player games. 
    This is mainly because I was reminded about the website that I set up in class while I was creating this website for homework. 
    That website contained a single picture, and that was a picturesque landscape from Breath of the Wild. 
    Remembering this, I wanted to make a list of my favorite adventure games, but the definition for what is an adventure game is rather loose in my experience. 
    I then transformed my list into single player games. 
    While I love all of the games on the list, I excluded some other games that I enjoy even more because they heavily featured multiplayer components.</p>
